# jsonedit

A command-line (terminal) tool to edit / create JSON files

```plain
$ npm install --global jsonedit
```

```plain
$ jsonedit test.json
key> name
value> jsonedit
key> version
value> 0.0.1
key> (type enter to break)
```

## Why?

Because manually writing JSON syntax is still hard,  
even though it's been much better compared to XML / HTML.

Think about the `{`, `}`, `:`, `"` things..

## Todo

Everything.. such as

- other types like `number`, `null`
- nested `object` or `array`
- field removing
- field sorting
